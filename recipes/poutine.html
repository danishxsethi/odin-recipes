    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 kg Russet potatoes (cut into sticks)</li>
      <li>2 cups Cheese curds (fresh and squeaky)</li>
      <li>2 cups Beef broth</li>
      <li>2 tbsp Butter</li>
      <li>2 tbsp All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Fries:</strong> Soak the cut potatoes in cold water
        for 1 hour to remove starch. Drain and pat dry completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>First Fry (Blanching):</strong> Heat oil to 300°F (150°C). Fry
        potatoes for 5-8 minutes until soft but not brown. Remove and cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the Gravy:</strong> In a saucepan, melt butter and whisk in
        flour to make a roux. Slowly add beef broth, whisking constantly until
        thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Second Fry (Crisping):</strong> Increase oil heat to 375°F
        (190°C). Fry the potatoes again for 2-4 minutes until golden brown and
        crispy. Drain on paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble:</strong> Place hot fries in a bowl. Sprinkle cheese
        curds generously on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong> Pour the hot gravy over the fries and curds
        immediately so the cheese slightly melts. Eat with a fork!
      </li>
    </ol>
