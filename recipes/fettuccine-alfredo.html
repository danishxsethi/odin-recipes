    </p>

    <h3>Ingredents</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb Fettuccine pasta</li>
      <li>1/2 cup Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 cup Heavy cream (or whipping cream)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 clove Garlic (minced, optional)</li>
      <li>Salt, fresh black pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook Pasta:</strong> Boil water and cook the fettuccine al dente
        according to package directions. Reserve 1 cup of the starchy pasta
        water before draining.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make Sauce Base:</strong> In a wide pan, melt the butter over
        low heat. Add garlic (if using) and cook for 1 minute. Add the heavy
        cream and simmer for 2-3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Emulsify:</strong> Remove the pan from the heat. Add the grated
        Parmesan cheese and whisk quickly and constantly until the cheese melts
        and the sauce is smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Toss:</strong> Add the drained fettuccine to the sauce. Toss
        immediately to coat evenly. Add reserved pasta water 1 tablespoon at a
        time if the sauce is too thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Finish:</strong> Season with salt, black pepper, and a tiny
        pinch of nutmeg. Serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
