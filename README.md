# Odin Recipes

This project is a basic recipe website built as part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. The goal was to build a multi-page website using only standard HTML, focusing on proper structure and file management.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I practiced and demonstrated the following skills:

- **HTML Structure:** Writing semantic HTML5 boilerplate and properly nesting elements.
- **Text Formatting:** Using headings (h1-h6), paragraphs, bold (`strong`), and italics (`em`) to organize content.
- **Lists:** Creating both ordered (`ol`) and unordered (`ul`) lists for steps and ingredients.
- **Media & Links:** Embedding images and creating hyperlinks using both absolute and relative file paths.
- **Version Control:** Using Git for atomic commits and pushing code to GitHub.
- **File Management:** Organizing a project with proper directory structures for pages and images.
